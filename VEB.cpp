/*
Van embe boas tree
Implemented by : Phirasit Charoenchitseriwong

This tree performs better than normal BSTs
with running time of O(log log U) instead of
O(log N). This result leads to a new approach
for dealing with dictionary.

VEB consists of exploiting bit and also resursive tree.
This tree is not an improved one so the memory require
is O(U log log U) however this can improve easily.

Everyone is free to use this code.
The author personally believe that the code is bug-free.
